This is a super simple program that determines the smallest number of rolls it would take to clear a snakes and ladders board and prints it to the console.
It takes an input for the size of a board, then the starting and ending locations for a series of snakes and ladders. 
Example:
10      "Size of board"
9 29    "start" "end"
27 14   "start" "end"

Bugs: none that I can find
Notes: It is a little messy and could probably be optimized/cleaned up some more.
